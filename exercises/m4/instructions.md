# Module 4 - Direct Messages

## General Instructions

The exercises have two directories, the `before` directory is where you will work and the `after ` directory contains the solution. If you want to check that the solution works then change directories to the `after` directory and run `gradle build`. You should then be able to do `gradle Consumer:run` then open another terminal window and do a `gradle Producer:run`, you should see the producer produce a message and the consumer print out that message.
